# Topic: 
Construction Safety and Productivity, Human-Centered Approaches. Focus on weareble devices.

# Research question:
How do construction workers perceive wearable sensors, and how can their perceptions inform human-centered strategies to address workplace fatigue, improve safety, and enhance productivity and well-being?

# Why It Matters: 
Perceptions affect acceptance and successful use of wearable technologies. Insights can guide managers to design more ethical, practical, and effective implementations.


I put my text here. It is expected that workers will recognize the benefits of wearable sensors in monitoring fatigue and improving safety and productivity. However, they may express concerns regarding privacy, comfort, and constant monitoring. Insights from workersâ€™ perceptions will likely highlight the importance of designing human-centered strategies that balance technological monitoring with respect for personal boundaries and well-being

This is a paragraph. Knowing and understanding workers' perceptions of the technology being implemented helps ensure its adoption and implementation in an ethical and safe manner. This allows construction managers to boost operational productivity, employee well-being, and, above all, foster a culture of safety.
